# Overview

I wanted to learn more about networking. 
At work, I have been working more with servers. 
In this case, my client is a PC. 
I know how to code in Python the best. 
So, I wrote this program in python. 

Essentially what my server does, is echos what information it receives from the client. 
The client will send a message. 
The server will receive the message and then send it back. 
Upon receiving the message back, the client will print that it received the message. 

I do have a video demoinng that down below.

# Network Communication

For my network, I used the client-server model. 
I have code for a client and a server. 

I used TCP as I didn't want to lose any data. 
The port number that I used was 65432.

I used terminal formatting. 
It shows the way your terminal is set. 

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to write my program. 

I wrote the code in Python and my ReadMe file in Markdown. 
I did use a python library called socket to help me communicate between the client and the server. 

# Useful Websites

This website helped me a ton. I followed it's tutorial.

# Future Work
In the future, I'd like to make the following changes. 
* Add more requests to the server.
I'd like the user to be able to input some numbers and have the server calculate the result.
* Understand more about the socket. 
I had a python library that helped me do a lot of the socket work.
